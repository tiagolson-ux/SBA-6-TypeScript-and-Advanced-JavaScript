### E-Commerce Product Management System  
Author: **Tia Noel**

##  Overview

This project is a simple **E-commerce Product Management System** built for SBA 6 using:

- TypeScript  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Async/Await  
- API calls  
- Custom error handling  
- Helper utilities (discount + tax calculations)

The app fetches product data from the **DummyJSON Products API**, processes it using a `Product` class, calculates discounts and tax, and prints formatted output in the terminal.
